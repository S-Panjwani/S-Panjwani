I like building software that does something interesting.
Most of my projects involve automation, computer vision, or algorithms.

## Projects
- **Computer Vision Blackjack** – real‑time card detection and decision logic  
- **Minimax Tic‑Tac‑Toe (Private)** – perfect‑play AI with a simple GUI  
- **Video Generator (Private)** – automated video creation for a youtube shorts channel I used to run  
- **Raspberry Pi Handheld** – coming soon
