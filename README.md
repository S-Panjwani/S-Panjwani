I like building software that does something interesting.
Most of my projects involve automation, computer vision, or algorithms.

## Projects
- **Computer Vision Blackjack** – real‑time card detection and decision logic  
- **Video Generator (Private)** – automated video creation for a youtube shorts channel I used to run
- **study.cavemansoftware.org** – website dedicated to local students sharing notes with each other (old. revamp soon)
- **Raspberry Pi Handheld** – coming soon
